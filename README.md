## Background

I'm working to refine several skills and wanted a fresh project to work on that would be a fun, low stakes way to experiment with some new things. I aim to make messes and break things here. The mains things I'm experimenting with are: 
 * Improving my skills in TDD
 * Learning MongoDB
 * Learning Github actions and some CI/CD techniques.
 * Integrating AI tools like Retrieval Augmentend Generation. 

The project itself will be a handy way to help develop and track campaigns for games like Dungeons and Dragons. The idea is to be able to build and continuously evolve your campaign, and an AI assistant will be aware of all of your campaign details. It can help you generate new items, monsters, encounters, locations, etc.
